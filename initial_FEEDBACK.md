| Result  | Description                                      |
|---------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **YES-** | Has good usability (purpose, good prompts)      |
| **YES-** | Has correct number of players                   |
| **YES-** | User chooses number of sticks to start with     |
| **YES-** | Error checking on number of sticks to start with|
| **YES-** | Error checking on number of sticks picked up    |
| **YES-** | User player logic is correct                    |
| **YES-** | Computer player logic is correct                |

| **NO-** | Is a proper algorithm                           |

### Comments on the grading
- If there are NOs in this FEEDBACK document, address it according to the description
- All descriptions in this algorithm and processes looks good However, this is not the proper way to write an algorithm. You need to be using indentation, numbering and some kind of Input output mechanisms. Please take a look at the lecture notes on how we develop each algorithm.
