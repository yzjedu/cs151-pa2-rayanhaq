I was supposed to learn/ accomplish how to Practice with protecting against bad user input
Practice with decision-making, An opportunity to use looping.The steps I followed were from my algorothm. Just needing to be able to understand how to code it carefully. Key concepts explored was just getting the user erros down and etc. It took a while for my results to match with what I was trying to get but in the end it did all work out. Didnt really try test cases becuase it wasnt required. The challenges I encountered were just teh error checking. I overcame the first 3 steps by just keeping my head down and sticking to the principles. Not really amny key takeaways. It was for sure hard working by my self. I had to rely on other resources when I could have just asked my partner if I was working with him.
